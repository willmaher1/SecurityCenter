# security center
The Security Center is an application for users to centrally manage computer cleanup and security settings that may be hard to find.

This application allows a user to Scan their computer, set their Network settings, and more is planned.

The user merely has to run this application, allow it to run as an elevated user, and it will initiate a quick scan, or a full scan of their computer.

The user can also set their Network settings to block malware, adult content, or ads.  Behind the scenes, this is setting the user's computer to use DNS servers from Cloudflare (with varying levels of blocking),
or use AdGuard DNS to block malware, adult content, and ads.
